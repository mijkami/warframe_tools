Damage(version 3.0) is a system that determines the damage done to a certain target by a given attacker. Damage results are modified by several mechanics –damage type modifiers(main content of this article),armor,critical hit bonuses,stealth bonuses,Warframe ability debuffs,body part modifiers,faction modifiers, and other sources ofdamage reduction– which are discussed below and on their respective pages.
All damage dealt by any weapon or ability belongs to a certain damage type, and every target has specific resistances and vulnerabilities to different damage types. In-game, enemy resistances and vulnerabilities can be seen in the player'sCodexafter scanning at least one enemy of a particular type or by aiming at an enemy using theSynthesis Scannerwith theData-Parse Widget. Exploiting enemy vulnerabilities and avoiding resistances by means of weapon selection and mod installation may significantly improve players' damage output.
Since its predecessorDamage 2.0, all different Health, Armor, and Shield types have been simplified into one type for each (e.g. Grineer'sCloned FleshandMachineryis now just "Health",Ferrite ArmorandAlloy Armoris now just "Armor", andShieldandProto Shieldis now just "Shield"). Vulnerabilities and resistances have also been decoupled from health types and are now solely based on the enemyFaction(e.g. allGrineerare now exclusively vulnerable toImpactandCorrosiveat all times, regardless of the presence of armor or shields, and no longer have any resistances).
