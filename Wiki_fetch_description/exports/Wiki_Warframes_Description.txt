The Warframe is an advanced weapons system used exclusively by the Tenno in their missions throughout the Origin System . The Warframes possess regenerative shields , greatly enhanced mobility , and the use of an array of supernatural abilities – all of which further augment the Tenno's deadly use of traditional combat arts.
Warframes are divided into a collection of diverse models, each of which personifies a great warrior spirit. Players may don Excalibur to gain his prowess with bladed weapons, for instance. Each Warframe is moreover highly reconfigurable, meaning players can tailor their choice of Warframe to fit a multitude of playstyles. While certain Warframes excel in a particular situation, none are limited to a singular role and no role demands the use of a singular Warframe.
Players customize Warframes via the installation of Mods which can upgrade their Warframe Attributes , endow them with additional utilities, and even alter their abilities. Further bonuses can be achieved by equipping add-ons, such as Arcane Helmets or Arcane Enhancements .
Each Warframe features four unique and extraordinary activatable powers that allow for a large degree of control over the surrounding environment. Warframes also possess passive abilities – powers that activate on their own accord. These powers allow a Tenno to cast virtually anything, with examples ranging from devastating waves of energy , to bullet-nullifying barriers , mass healing , portals to the stars beyond , radial waves of antimatter , and even ethereal weapons . Warframes greatly augment the physical abilities of a Tenno as well, affecting natural skills like swordsmanship , marksmanship and, most notably, acrobatics .
New players start the game by selecting their first Warframe, from Excalibur , Mag , or Volt , and playing through the Vor's Prize Introductory Quest . As the player progresses, they may craft or buy other Warframes from the full list of offerings.
As of Hotfix 39.0.5 , there are a total of 109 Warframes consisting of both original models and special variants. Only one of these special variants is exclusive to a certain group of players; Excalibur Prime is Founders-exclusive . Of the distinct Warframes, 28 are male, 26 are female, and 2 are non-binary.
We took the twisted few that had returned from that place. We built a frame around them, a conduit of their affliction. Gave them the weapons of the old ways. Gun and blade. A new warrior, a new code was born. These rejects, these Tenno , became our saviors. Warrior-Gods cast in steel and fury striking our enemies in a way they could never comprehend. Excalibur was the first.
Warframes are highly advanced, bio-mechanical suits of armor that were used by the Tenno during The Old War [ 1 ] . Unlike Dax , another Orokin infantry, Warframes able to channel Void energy and safely enter Infestation Outbreaks. [ 2 ] It was revealed by Ballas that Warframes are created from a specialized form of the Infestation called the Helminth . Originally cultivated to prevent to a converted host's mind from falling under the Technocyte influence, the first Warframes ultimately regressed into feral animals. To remedy this, the Orokin enlisted the survivors of the Zariman Ten Zero accident; along with the use of Transference , these ' Operators ' would control the now tamed Warframes, using them as battle proxies and becoming a warrior caste known as the Tenno .
Despite the Operators control and the influence of the Technocyte, some Warframes who did not yet fully succumb still retained their awareness, with some notable frames being Excalibur Umbra [ 3 ] , Dante [ 4 ] , Kullervo [ 5 ] , Dagath [ 6 ] , Jade [ 7 ] and the Stalker .
As The Old War raged on, Sentients , with their ability to adapt and take over technology, would easily counter any of the Orokin's attacks. On the brink of losing the war, Orokin Executor Ballas chose a different route, turning to the flesh and disease of the Infestation . Cultivating a new hybridized strain called the Helminth [ 8 ] , Ballas would inoculate the strongest subjects that could be found, volunteers or not; even including the Orokin's own Dax soldiers, creating the first generation of Warframes .
During the conversion process, the subject's skin would harden into sword-like steel [ 9 ] , while their organs would interlink and hybridized to improve resilience. However, the conversion would also render the subject unable to speak coherently, only being able to produce metallic screams, howls, and groans [ 10 ] . Despite their Infested nature, these hosts remained relatively sane for a time, able to operate and and obey via their own free will, although they were considered dangerous and were often feared by those they were meant to defend.
These Warframes where then sent out into the battlefields in an attempt to turn the war in the Orokin's favor. However, the Technocyte's corrupting prescience would soon prove too much, turning them into little more than savage and feral animals, leading most to violently rebel against the Orokin. The Orokin, deciding these frames to now be defective, had no choice but purge and eradicate nearly all of them. In an attempt to extend their control, Ballas ordered any future and surviving frames to undergo extensive torture and drug therapy to destroy their minds, hoping to render them into mindless puppets. [ 11 ]
Researchers were tasked with restraining the feral hosts within Lua , and if they were not rejected, would often perform live vivisections on them and any newly crafted Warfame, even recording their responses to torture for study. [ 12 ] Any frames who did not yet succumb to the frenzy went into hiding, becoming fugitives in the process, as it became an offense punishable by death or glassing if any were caught sheltering them.
Still desperate for victory, the Orokin's salvation would soon be found, almost by accident. Within Lua, a Rhino frame had gotten loose (presumably released by a researcher named Davis ). In an attempt to secure the beast, security forces would be deployed, but they were easily gored in an instant. As the frame squat down, eating the remains of the guards, it recognized one of the panicking researchers, remembering the tortures it had suffered by his hand. As it begins to lumber after the researcher, Davis open the door to an unknown cell and drags his colleague in. When the creature approached the doorway, it mysteriously went calm, with Davis revealing that the cell contained the survivors from the Zariman Ten Zero accident.
Due to this discovery, the the children of the Zariman would be enlisted, although now hidden away in the Reservior on Lua to control their chaotic Void powers. Through the creation of Transference , They would became the new ' Operators ' of the feral Warframes, as they were the only ones who managed to tame them. With their minds linked together, instead of resorting to force of will like the Orokin, the children instead chose compassion and empathy, being able to "see inside an ugly, broken thing and take away its pain" . [ 13 ]
Equipped with archaic ballistic and melee weapons, the newly operated Warframes were deployed onto the battlefield with great success against their Sentient assailants, finally turning the tide of war in the Orokin's favor. [ 14 ]
While the Old War continued, Warframes were also employed to control the Orokin's colonies [ 15 ] , to serve as political assassins [ 16 ] , and to purge Infestation outbreaks. [ 17 ] Any details surrounding the truth of the Warframes and their Tenno operators were kept hidden by the Council of Executors. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] A mythos surrounding them were created to mask the source of their power and to incite fear throughout the Orokin Empire. [ 21 ] Due to their sparse numbers, civilian populations in the current WARFRAME era may still believe in these ancient myths about the Warframes and Tenno. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]
According to the Drifter, most of the modern-day Warfarmes are replications of the originals. When the Drifter performs Transference into a Warframe, they take on some fragments of that Warframe's personality, such as their stance or the way they move.
Warframes are obtained by two general methods: crafting them with in-game materials at the Foundry or purchasing them fully assembled from the Market . Additionally, obtaining a Warframe requires the use of a storage slot. Players possess a finite number of storage slots, which can be expanded by purchasing additional slots at the Market.
Assembling a Warframe at the Foundry requires the Warframe's main blueprint and three component parts:
To construct a Warframe, players must first assemble each of its components. This is performed by expending Resources earned throughout the game, including a copy of the part's corresponding blueprint . Component blueprints are generally obtained by completing appropriate Assassination missions, Quests , or Clan Dojo research , though exceptions exist. After collecting and assembling all of the necessary parts, players can purchase the Warframe's main blueprint from the Market with Credits (the game's free-to-play currency) to complete the construction process. Once assembled, a Warframe may be upgraded at any time with the installation of an Orokin Reactor .
Warframes can also be purchased fully assembled in the Market with Platinum . When acquired in this manner, a Warframe comes pre-installed with an Orokin Reactor and is provided with a complimentary Warframe storage slot.
Players begin the game with three Warframe storage slots and can acquire additional slots from the Market for a nominal fee of 20 Platinum each (Players also gain a complimentary slot for any Warframe purchased directly from the Market). Warframe slots can also be acquired through Nightwave . Note that a player can acquire Platinum without spending real world money by trading with other players .
Attributes are the stats and functionality of Warframes such as Health , Armor , Shields , Energy , and Sprint Speed . Each Warframe is made unique with a different combination of these and their powers.
Warframes require Affinity, conventionally known in other games as experience points (XP), in order to attain higher ranks. Each Warframe levels up separately from other Warframes to a maximum of Rank 30. Note that each of the Warframe's equipped weapons have Affinity rankings as well which also increase separately from Warframes. During missions, players are awarded Affinity through actions getting such as killing enemies, using abilities, completing objectives or reviving downed allies.
With each successive rank, a Warframe gains mod capacity as well as increases to Health , Shields , and Energy capacity, as well as 200 mastery points . Stat boosts received from ranking up are calculated from the base value of the Warframe for each stat, preventing mods from affecting the bonus.
During level up, all Warframe stats gain:
For a total of +100 Health, +100 Shields and +50 Energy capacity at Rank 30.
For a total of +100 Health, +100 Armor , +15% Ability Strength , +50 Energy capacity, and +15 Health/s Regeneration at Rank 30.
Since Update 15.0 (2014-10-24), Warframe Abilities unlock and rank up with affinity. The maximum Rank for any Ability is Rank 3.
Every Warframe can equip various kinds of alternative equipment or skins. These cosmetic items include Helmets , Idle Animations , holographic Emblems , Sigils and Cosmetic Armor .
Some of these items are available by default, some can either be bought from the Market or found as blueprints via the Cred Offering system. They can all be equipped in the Arsenal under the Appearance Tab.












Update 38.0 (2024-12-13)
Throughout the New Player Experience improvements we’ve made this year, the biggest point of feedback we’ve received is to increase the starting Weapon and Warframe Slots amounts. So we’ve done just that!
New players will now start with more Slots:
If you’re an existing player, these additional Warframe (1) and Weapon Slots (3) will be delivered to you via inbox message on log in!
Update 34.0 (2023-10-18)
If you’ve spent any time invested in the deeper nuances of Modding, you may be familiar with “Warframe Math” - math that upon first glance doesn’t really make sense, but once you learn the inner workings of the game, it all comes together. While we can appreciate the value that complex systems offer to a certain subsect of players, there are other aspects of the game that should have clear and understandable outcomes. Namely: Shield, Health, Energy, and Armor Modding.
Pop quiz: what is 300 + 440%? If you answered 740, you may just be an Excalibur player.
Vitality (+440% Heath), Redirection (+440% Shields), Flow (+150% Energy), and Steel Fiber (+110% Armor) come with large modifier values that don’t seem to match their outcome in-game. This is because these Mods apply their multiplier to the base stats of the Warframe - i.e., the stats you have at Rank 0. In the Excalibur example, a Rank 30 Excalibur’s Health stat of 300 earns an additional 440 Health from max rank Vitality (+440% Heath) since it applies to his base rank Health stat of 100, resulting in 740 total health.
In this update, we have removed this obfuscation by having Health, Shield, Energy, and Armor Mods apply to the stats of Warframes at their current rank. Continuing our Excalibur example, instead of Vitality always applying to Excalibur’s base rank 100 Health, it would apply to his Health stat based on his rank - namely, the stat you can actually see in your Arsenal. If your Excalibur were Rank 30, his Health stat would be 300, which means Vitality’s multiplier would be calculated off of 300.
With previous Health and Mod values, additional adjustments are needed to make this revision work while maintaining game balance. By only changing where the multiplier applies, a Rank 30 Excalibur would receive an extra 1,320 Health from max rank Vitality, resulting in a total health stat of 1,600. This outcome is a significant buff, which is not the intention of this system change.
To remedy this, we approached this problem in two ways:
1 - We reduced the overall multiplier for Health, Shield, Energy, and Armor Mods. Since these now affect Max Rank Warframe stats, these Mods need to scale differently to maintain the status quo. Additionally, we wanted these new values to be as clear and understandable to all players as possible! Here are a few examples of these value changes:
Note: These are not all of the Mods affected by this change. We share the comprehensive list further down in this section of the update notes.
Doing some quick math, this means that a Rank 30 Excalibur (300 Health) with a reworked Vitality Mod (+100% Health, applied to the final Health stat) would receive 300 extra Health, for a total of 600. That, in contrast, is a nerf, which we also don’t want to do.
So, our next step:
2 - We adjusted Warframe Health, Shield, Energy, and Armor values to keep the end result of the revised Mods as close to the original values as possible.
With this change, Excalibur’s Rank 30 Health stat is 370. With +100% Health from a max Vitality Mod, his resulting Health stat would be 740, which matches what it was originally.
While this path to the same result may seem a little complicated, the outcome matches our intention: we want players to be able to look at their Health, Shield, and Armor Mods, and be able to understand how they affect the stats they see in their Arsenal.
In addition to everything above, we also increased the base stat values for Warframes so that these revised Mods offer similar value for lower-ranked Frames. To do so, we reduced the amount of Health/Shield/Energy that Warframes earn per rank in half, and transferred the sum of that value to their base stats.
For Armor , this is the one stat that does not increase with your Warframe’s level (with some exceptions). Armor values across the board have been slightly increased to compensate for the Mod changes.
Not to beat a dead Kaithe, but Mods will now be applying to the Max Rank stat instead of the Base Rank. You may look at these numbers and think “nerf” or “buff” depending, but the outcome is that total Modded values are the same, if not a little higher in some cases. Here are a few outliers before we get into the nitty-gritty of it:
