Mods, short forModifications[1][2]orModules, are the upgrade system inWARFRAMEin the form of special cards that can be equipped onWarframes,weapons,companions, andvehiclesto enhancedamage, power, survivability, speed, mobility,precepts, and utility.
The Mods system is accessible after the completion of "Liberate the imprisoned arms dealer" tutorial mission from theVor's PrizeQuest, by installing the Mods Segment reward from said mission onto theOrbiter, which will permanently unlock the Mods system for use via theArsenal("Upgrade").
From theArsenal, you can install mods on your equipment, but they are limited by the equipment's mod capacity that depends on the level of the equipment. Any mod can be installed/removed freely and can be applied to several equipment at the same time. You can also upgrade your mods by usingEndoEndoEndoandCreditsCreditsCreditsthrough the process ofFusion.
Mods have several attributes:
For mods of the lowest 4 tiers (Common-Legendary), their rarity defines both increasing with rarity applicablefusioncosts andtradingtaxes (being highest for Legendary out of all mods in game), while the 5 highest tiers (Riven-Requiem) share these with Rare mods (except Peculiar - sharing with Uncommon instead).
Most mods have an increasing number of diamonds at the top of their mod cards depending on their rarity. In the order of increasing rarity these are:
The other tiers do not have rarity pips displayed on their mod cards, and instead may be distinguished by a unique material on their mod cards. In the order of increasing rarity these are:
Plexusmods have a unique styling mimicking theRailjackaesthetic:
Multiple specialized UI environments exist to facilitate players' various interactions with mods:
Introduced inUpdate 12.0(2014-02-05), mods of the same type and fusion level are placed into an item stack, with a number on the top left showing how many of that item is available. This process is essential in reducing clutter and is also used to ease the process of selling or dissolving mods.
Once the Mods system has been unlocked, mods can be installed by visiting theArsenalon yourOrbiter, selecting the desired Mod destination (e.g.Warframe,Weapon), and then clicking on theUPGRADEbutton. Afterward either click onACTIONS>APPLY AUTO INSTALLATION, or simply drag a mod from the collection and drop it on a Mod slot. Mod installation and removal is instant and free.
Mods are placed inMod Slots(commonly referred to as "slots"), arrayed in a rectangular grid. In addition to thesegeneral slots, which are compatible with the vast majority of mods, some types of equipment havespecial slots, which are only compatible with a corresponding class of mods.
The number and type of slots an item will have depends on the type of equipment:
Items have a limitedMod Capacity, that correlates to their Rank. The maximum rank is normally30, but for some items it is40. Warframes/Companions/Archwings/K-Drives/Necramechs and Weapons can be supercharged with anOrokin ReactororOrokin Catalystrespectively, which doubles the available Mod capacity. Mod Capacity functions as a limit to what mods can be equipped depending on their drain. Mods can have adrainof 0 to as high as 20 depending on the mod and what rank it is. Items also have a minimum mod capacity, which adds mod points onto items that are a lower rank than a player's currentMastery Rank. The amount of minimum mod capacity is 15, plus1per 2Mastery Ranks.
If the Mod Capacity drain is less or equal to the item’s remaining Mod Capacity it will install and Mod Capacity will be deducted.
Mod drain is modified byPolarity:
AuraandStancemods increase Mod Capacity rather than drain it.
TheRailjackanalogue of the Arsenal is thePlexus, also located in the Orbiter, and accessible from a Dry Dock.
Mods can have their overall power increased by the process calledFusion. Fusing a mod withEndoincreases the rank, and thereby overall power, of the mod. While the base amount of Endo required to level up from rank 0 to rank 1 is determined by Mods' rarity, each subsequent rank-up requires twice the Endo amounts from the previous rank-up (e.g. Leveling a common mod from rank 0 to rank 1 requires 10 Endo, from rank 1 to rank 2 requires 20, from rank 2 to rank 3 require 40, and so forth).
Transmutation is one of the ways of acquiring mods. Choosing this Mod Action, players can sacrifice four selected unranked mods to generate a random mod from a list of mods that can be acquired in this way. Alternatively, three selected mods and oneTransmutation Corecan be used to guarantee a random mod of a specificpolarity. Transmutation ofRiven Modsrequires aRiven Transmuter. Mods that cannot be acquired by transmutation are conventionally calleduntransmutable mods.
Choosing this Mod Action, a player can convert a mod into an amount ofCreditsequal to75%of the Credits invested in the mod[3]. Any selection of single mods and/or stacks of mods can be sold, and players are prompted to review and confirm the action after clicking"Sell"(after a mod has been "sold" this way, it isn't physically found anywhere – it has been eliminated). Notably,Riven Modscannot be sold.
Choosing this Mod Action, a player can convert a mod into a set amount ofEndo, equal to75%of the Endo invested in the mod[3]. Riven mods have a special calculation(see the table below). Any selection of single mods and/or stacks of mods can be sold, and players are prompted to review and confirm the action after clicking"Dissolve".
Standard mods (orsingle-stat mods) are the basicclass of mods: all the mods that provide a straightforward bonus to a single stat. In each item category, each base stat only corresponds to one standard mod. At times, changes to game mechanics have included total redesigns of some mods to become a different single-stat mod or dual-stat mods (e.g.Quickening), but these are still essentially standard mods. Standard mods are generally equipped in one of the main slots, but some areExilusmods.
A standard mod may come in six variants:Normal,Flawed,Primed,Umbra,Amalgam,Galvanized, andArchon. In addition to being eligible for these variants, standard mods may also have a unique variant.
Rarity only somewhat corresponds to classes of mods: some standard mods are Rare, and some nonstandard mods are Common.
Playerscannotinstall duplicate mods onto a single piece of equipment. Likewise, different variants of the same modcannotbe equipped together. For example, a given pistol can only accept oneHornet Strikemod at a time, andFlow,Primed Flow, andArchon Flowcan't be installed together on a single Warframe.
Normal standard mods generally drop from regular enemies, and are the most easily obtainable mods. They are transmutable, sellable and tradeable.
Flawed mods are aninferior variantof standard mods. They have a maximum rank of 3, and provide an overall reduced effect. They are automatically picked up during the course of theVor's Prizequest. Flawed mods are untransmutable and untradeable. The quest in which are they are obtained is not replayable, so there is no way to gain additional Flawed mods subsequent to it. Visually, Flawed mods have a cracked image.
Primed mods are asuperior variantof mods, that have had their maximum rank increased to 10. Most Primed mods can be obtained fromBaro Ki'Teer, but four Primed mods,Primed Fury,Primed Vigor,Primed Shred, andPrimed Sure Footedare only obtained from 200/400/600/900Daily Tributesand cannot be traded with players. All Primed mods are of the Legendary rarity, and they are untransmutable.
Umbra mods are a class of Legendary mods, that feature the properties of both Primed mods andSet Mods. All are asuperior variantof a standard mod, while also possessing asecond statthat grants enhanced effectiveness when fightingSentientenemies. They are divided in sets, but the Set Bonus of each set is the same: an increase of each mod's bonuses. Umbra mods are acquired through theThe SacrificeQuest(and can thereafter be reacquired viaCephalon Simaris). They are untransmutable and untradeable. All Umbra mods have the exclusiveUmbra polarity that can only be applied with anUmbra Forma. Visually, Umbra mods are Legendary mods with a set indicator.
Amalgam mods can be either slightly inferior or superior variants, and come with certainadditional properties. Some sacrifice a small amount of their main bonus to provide a small bonusto another stat of an altogether different item. Others are weapon-specific, and are actually superior variants, while still having a second stat. The latter also usually have a third stat, generally understood as a novelty/utility feature (e.g. extra gore). Amalgam mods do not have a formal Rarity tier, but yield the same amount of Credits and Endo when sold and dissolved, respectively, as Rare mods. They are untransmutable and untradeable. Thematically, they are amalgamations of two existing mods (so for example,Amalgam Serrationcan be seen as a combination ofSerrationandRush). These mods have a distinct Sentient-influenced visual styling.
Galvanized mods have slightly inferior base stats than their original counterpart, but in turn have stacking buffs from killing enemies that make them asuperior variantto standard mods. Their maximum ranks are increased to 10. Galvanized mods do not have a formal Rarity tier, but yield the same amount of Credits and Endo when sold and dissolved, respectively, as Rare mods. Galvanized mods are purchased from theArbitrationsvendor for 20Vitus Essenceeach.
Introduced inVeilbreaker, Archon mods are a special variant of Warframe mods that trigger special effectsupon using Warframe Abilities that satisfy conditionssuch as killing an enemy with a particular element, causing an elemental proc, or healing. All currently existing Archon mods have a max rank of 10 and have rank up costs similar to Legendary mods. Archon mods are purchased usingStockfromChipperupon reaching Rank 3 (Fort) withKahl's Garrison.
Nonstandard mods are all the other mods that provide bonuses to either the same stats as the standard mods or to certain other stats, or modify equipment in specific ways. They come in different classes and have a more varied design. Nonstandard modsstackwith other mods providing the same type of bonus (certain exceptions exist). Therefore,Vitality(a standardHealthmod) stacks withVigor(a Nightmare mod, providing both aHealthandShieldbonus). They generally do not have variants (a small number of Primed Nightmare mods are one exception).
Nightmare Mode Mods (commonly calledNightmare Mods) are a class of Raredual-stat mods– they provide a bonus to two different statsfor the same item. They can be acquired through completing missions in theNightmare Mode. Nightmare mods are untransmutable. Visually, they do not have a clearly distinguishing mark.
Corrupted mods are a class of Rare mods that affectone stat positively and another negatively. Those available for warframes are characterized by extremely high bonuses balanced by major penalties. Those available for weapons provide bonuses of a similar strength to their standard mod analogues, while still also having a penalty. Corrupted mods can be obtained from theOrokin Derelict, using specialDragon Keysto unlock vaults located within. They are untransmutable. Visually, they do not have a clearly distinguishing mark.
Conditional mods are mods thatrequire some condition to be met during combatin order for their effect to activate. A large subset of these mods are calledAcolytemods, and these now drop inDeimosbounties; others are dropped in the same manner as standard mods (notably,Condition Overload). Acolyte mods are untransmutable, and the remainder may or may not be. Visually, they do not have a clearly distinguishing mark.
Many Set mods and some Augments (e.g.Hata-Satya) also have a conditional effect.
Augment mods (commonly called Augments) provide augmentation to aspecific Warframe or weapon. On Warframes, they alter abilities or passives. On weapons, they provide straight up bonuses, sometimes superior to standard mods (e.g.Scattered Justice). Most can be obtained asSyndicate Offerings, but a significant number is obtained elsewhere (for example, some areExecutioner Mods). They are untransmutable. Augments granting Syndicate effects are overlaid with their Syndicate logo.
Riven Mods providerandomized bonusesto aspecific weapon: up to three bonuses, and a penalty. The bonuses on Rivens tend to be based around standard mods (normal or primed), and these base bonuses are modified by a stat individual to each weapon called disposition. When acquired, Riven Mods come in a veiled form which supplies no stats and must have a challenge completed in order to unveil it. They are transmutable using aRiven Transmuter, and transmutation produces a veiled Riven. The only way to obtain unveiled Riven Mods directly is by trading with players. Riven mods are purple.
Set Mods are a class ofModsthat offer increasing bonuses when one or more mods in a set are equipped together in a current loadout. Each mod of a set, apart from it's individual effects, also provides a secondSet Bonuseffect shared between all the mods in the set, that becomes stronger the more of the set's mods are installed. Many set mods have conditional effects, and some even figure as dual-stat conditional mods (e.g.Motus Setup). Set mods are untransmutable. They are distinguishable by their shared set prefix (e.g. Augur, Gladiator, Vigilante, etc.) and icon on top of their card.
The following types of mods have a special, dedicated slot.
Aura Mods are Warframe mods that benefit the entireSquadand also increase the player's Warframe total mod capacity. They can only be equipped in the dedicated Aura slot and only one Aura can be equipped to a Warframe. They can normally be obtained fromNightwaveCred offerings, but some drop fromThe Silver Grovespecters andNox. They are untransmutable.
Stance mods are special mods forMelee Weapons. They increase the player's melee weapon mod capacity and unlock unique attack combos. They can only be equipped in the dedicated Stance slot for a specific weapon type and only one Stance can be equipped to a melee weapon. Most Stance mods are transmutable.
Exilus Mods are utility or mobility-based mods that can be equipped in the Exilus slot, or if the player chooses, in a general slot. The Exilus slot is present on all Warframes and primary and secondary weapons; on Warframes, it must be unlocked with anExilus Adapter, and on weapons, it must be unlocked with anExilus Weapon Adapter.
Some Exilus mods exist as typical standard mods, e.g.Sure FootedandPrimed Sure Footed.
Some Exilus mods exist as somewhat atypical, but also essentially standard, mods:
Many Exilus mods are nonstandard mods, such as the the dual-stat "Drift" mods.
Exilus mods have the Exilus mark near the top.
Peculiar Mods are a subtype of Exilus mods. They do not offer any mechanical effects at all, instead only causing bizarre cosmetic effects. These mods, despite offering no real benefit to their users, are some of the rarest and most difficult to obtain artifacts in the system. They have a distinct smoky appearance.
Mods that do not fit in the above categories:
Precepts are mods which alter the behavior of aCompanion, and are effectively the companion's "abilities". Every Companion has their own specific precepts. However, there are precepts that are universal within a class of companions. Upon acquiring a companion, the user is automatically granted some or all of the respective specific precept mods.
Precepts have "informally" designated slots by virtue of having thePenjaga polarity, exclusive to them, and there being four matching-polarity slots on every companion. Since these are still general mod slots, the player can alter this setup in any number of ways, and Precepts can be installed in other slots as well. Companions will use their precepts in a prioritized order, where the top left slot is the highest priority and the bottom right slot is the lowest.
Players may not trade away / sell / dissolve a precept if it's their only copy of the mod.
Visually, Precepts do not have a clearly distinguishing mark (but can be identified in a glance by their polarity).
Parazon mods may only be equipped on theParazonand grant effects which are tied to the Mercy mechanic and hacking. A type of Parazon mods are Requiem mods, which are used to defeat a Kuva Lich.
Railjack Mods(also called Plexus Mods)are applied to theRailjack-modding platfrom calledPlexus. They are divided into three categories: Integrated, Battle, Tactical, each category being compatible with the respective mod grid within the Plexus. Integrated mods provide stat bonuses to the Railjack and it's Armaments, and include Railjack Aura mods. Battle Mods provide the Railjack with energy-based abilities, while Tactical Mods provide the Railjack with cooldown-based abilities. Mods in the latter two categories do not drain capacity, but are further divided into Defensive, Offensive, and Super subcategories, each corresponding to a single special slot. They drop inEmpyreanmissions, and are untransmutable. Visually, Railjack Mods can be identified by their molded alloy trim.
Conclave Mods can be mainly acquired from theConclaveSyndicate, where they originated from. Some of them can also be used in PvE (possibly with altered stats or effects) and can be obtained throughNightwaveCred offerings, while others are dropped bySentients.

The starting Mod Capacity for your gear (new or Forma'd) is now determined by your Mastery Rank and if an item has an Orokin Reactor or Catalyst installed.
For example, a Mastery 20 player would experience the following:
The formula is: Starting Mod Capacity = Mastery Rank (x2 if Orokin Reactor/Catalyst installed)
The cap on capacity remains unchanged.
Please note this is a slight deviation of our discussions on how Mastery Rank will reflect gear level, but by affecting capacity it fundamentally enables you to use Mods the moment you get your hands on new gear or Forma an item. Have fun!
